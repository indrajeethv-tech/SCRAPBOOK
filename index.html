    <p>
      Dear best friend, 💌 <br>
      Sometimes I get emotional about us 🥺 I don't always say it out loud... but you are one of the most special parts of my life ❤️✨ <br><br>

      We don't talk like we used to 💭, but that doesn't mean you stopped being my best friend 🤍 <br>
      You still hold a special place in my heart 💞 and in my life, everything has changed now... 🌙 <br><br>

      I'm not moving on 🚶‍♂️💔, but I will leave you be. <br>
      If you call, I'll answer 📞, if you text, I'll reply 💬 <br>
      I think about you even when I try not to 💭🥀 <br>
      I'll keep my distance 🚶‍♂️, but I will always wait ⏳, waiting for something that I know will never come... 🌫️ <br>
      Because I made you a promise 🤞✨, a promise I would be with you till the end ♾️ <br>
      That's a promise I'll never break 🔒🤍 <br><br>

      I miss you. 🥺 <br>
      No, let me correct that. I miss the old you 💔 <br>
      I miss the old you that treated me so well 🌸 <br>
      The old you that would talk to me every day 📱 and always have me smiling 😊 <br>
      I miss the old you that made me happy 🌷 and knew what to say at any given point in time 💬💞 <br>
